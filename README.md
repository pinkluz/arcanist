# arc

Arc is my knock off version of of the Phabricator arcanist tooling for a similar experience when using branch based workflows.

### flow

Outputs a graph of all your current branches that are tracking local branches to the CLI.

### cascade

Rebase all branches that are downstreams of the branch you are currently on.

### prune

Delete all branches where all commits in the branch are already contained in the parent.

### diff / commit

coming soon.
